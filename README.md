# 🍴 Food Classification & Nutrition Estimation

This project is an end-to-end deep learning pipeline that classifies food images into various categories and estimates their nutritional values (calories, protein, fat, and carbs). It uses a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model for classification and a Streamlit web app for a simple and interactive user interface.
